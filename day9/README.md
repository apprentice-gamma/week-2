Assignment #1

Create a calculator application. Your program should ask the user which operation they would like to perform: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or square root. Depending on the user’s response, your program should request that the user input either (1) or (2) numbers to perform the desired operation.

Your program should perform the appropriate calculation, display the result to the user, and ask if the user would like to perform another calculation. If so, the program should restart.

Your program should include error handling for bad input.

Assignment #2

A palindrome is a word which is exactly the same forward and backward (e.g., “mom”).

Write a program to determine whether a given word is a palindrome. Ask the user to enter a word, then print out whether or not the word is a palindrome.

Assignment #3

Write a game of Hangman. The program should give the user a word’s length, should allow the user to guess a limited number of times, should keep track of the letters the user has already guessed and display them upon request, and should offer up to (2) 1-letter hints on request.
